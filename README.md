HCV-TARGET plugins for REDCap

These REDCap plugins have been developed over a span of several years to meet the day-to-day needs of HCV-TARGET. Some of them are meant to derive new values from existing data. Some simply generate report data files and save them to the REDCap File Repository.

The /plugins directory is meant to be placed at the root of the REDCap server, at the same level as the redcap_vn.n.nn directory. Calls are made to the plugins by means of Project Bookmarks in REDCap.
