HCV-TARGET plugins for REDCap

These REDCap plugins have been developed over a span of several years to meet the day-to-day needs of HCV-TARGET. Some of them are meant to derive new values from existing data. Some simply generate report data files and save them to the REDCap File Repository.

The /plugins directory is meant to be placed at the root of the REDCap server, at the same level as the redcap_vn.n.nn directory. Calls are made to the plugins by means of Project Bookmarks in REDCap.

As with all of the HCV-TARGET repos, no warranty either express or implied is made for the suitability of any of this code to a given purpose. I cannot guarantee it will work for you. I can also not guarantee that if it works today, it won't break tomorrow. Such is the nature of HCV-TARGET. So here is us, on the raggedy edge. Furthermore, some of it is derivative of others' work. Where this is the case, attributions have been made in the source code.
